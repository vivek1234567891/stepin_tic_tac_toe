# Abstract
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a thought-provoking game which is performed on a panel of 3 by 3 grid consisting 9 boxes. Each participant is assigned a special symbol i.e. either X or O to demonstrate that the particular box is filled by the particular participant.
The empty boxes on the panel are chosen by the participants to mark their symbol on the game panel alternatively.
It is a game of perfect information which illustrates that the previously occurred actions are known to each participant at the time of decision. The winner of the game is the participant who first cover a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of the board having only their symbols.
